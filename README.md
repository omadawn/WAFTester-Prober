The Uberlabâ€™s WAFTester is a platform for use in testing, development, training and more for Web Application Firewalls. 

It consists of three primary components. A Vulnerable Web Application to test, A probing platform to simulate traffic both "valid" and attacks, and a WAF to place in between them. 

This repo is for the probing platform components.
